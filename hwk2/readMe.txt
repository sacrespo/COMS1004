Problem 1: 

For this problem, I created a class called Date, which used a month and a day 
to find the season. The findSeason() method is private, but is called in the 
constructor and is accessible through a getSeason() method. To find the 
season, there is a series of if/else if statements based on what month it is. 
If a user inputs a month that is not valid, the program spits out "Invalid 
date." 

Problem 2: 
For this problem, I created a Game class, which has a method that randomly 
places a car behind one of three doors (using a boolean true to denote the 
presence of a car), another method to simulate game play (a player randomly 
picking a door, then checking to see if the door has the car behind it - if it 
does not, it is implied the player must switch doors to win). There are two 
accessor methods to access the instance variable counters for the strategies 
of staying with a door versus switching doors.
